Thank you for your feedback.
If the app asks you for a password it means that you have set up a password. When you set up a password you can also set a recovery email address for situations when you don't remember your password.  If you didn't provide an email address we cannot reset your password.

cf7889c0-f4d0-4dba-9df8-120cf1a342a8,A Google user,,"unfortunately, if in adding a new account you go to browser to copy the URL, you'll return to this password manager to find your email address and password are lost. The app doesn't keep them. So you've got to remember every detail in one go. I've looked at several other password managers and none had such a good interface as this. Simple, logical.  But the above shortcoming needs to be addressed.",3,2,9/30/2016 11:40,"Hi Fyuuredhijgfzre,

Thank you for your kind words. Related to this issue, we believe that the Android system is resetting the app. This happens when you have a lot of apps running in the background. The system tries to allocate memory for the active apps and closes the background apps.
If the issue persist please contact support.

But no matter where I navigate its asking me to login with email id repeatedly. None of my apps are being listed under any category. Not sure if its just me or this app does not have any help section for novice users. Will try figuring it around for a bit else will uninstall.",2,2,9/17/2016 14:15,"Hello,

You need to add your accounts manually(websites/apps). When you add an account you can set different filters for it. You also have the possibility to add your own filters by going to the settings section. If you still encounter difficulties please contact support@managerpass.com and we will be very happy to help you.

It allows a number of options for filtering apps based on their function and assigning icons to each app for easier identification. The whole app can be protected with a password as well. My only complaint is that the password isn't required every time you open the app as long as the app is still running in the background.,5,1,9/14/2016 6:30,,,4,en,us
